A quiz app: https://acdc-gorilla.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/

The name is to honor the [first computer game of which one of the authors looked and debugged into the source code](https://archive.org/details/GorillasQbasic).

## Dev How-To

After cloning you can:
- Run the tests: `npm test`
- Start the server: `npm start`
- Push the app to CF: `cf push`

Besides Node.js, no extra tools are needed, cause big toolchains suck.
