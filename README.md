## Local Development

After cloning you can:
- Run the tests: `npm test`
- Start the server: `npm run dev`

If you want to run locally with same bindings as in production, e.g. enabling security:
- Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`
- Assign proper value these environment variables
- Start the server: `npm start`
