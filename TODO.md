# TODO
- podium screen: display score
- respond to roundStarted->roundFinished->...->gameFinished in the ui
- handle players getting out in middle of the game
- timer/countdown, and also consider the time to "scale" the score
- check animations etc. in chrome, edge, firefox, safari
- should participants see the other players?
- integrate with server using web sockets
- try implement both a WebSocket adapter and an HttpRestAdapter, both should work to be "plugged in" without changing the code
- try if using <> works, or understand why it doesn't work
