# TODO
- unify background color podium + general
- while joined player is waiting for quiz to start, should see the own avatar and the ones of the other players joining in
- deploy to CF and test performance (initial load vs cached) and device responsiveness
- simple eslint + formatter: use 4 spaces for indent, max 120 chars per line, no semicolon, always single quote (incl html)
- fix music not working on mobile device
- remove auto-transition for now, keep only next button
- fix font sizes on post-its
- fix resource handling, e.g. navigating to #/host/100003 or #/play/100003 should yield error if game doesn't exist
- close/delete game when finished, or auto-close a game 30min after it was started
- fix positioning of scaling of post-its and footer
- positioning of avatars on intermediate podium
- integrate stickies design in host + play screens (see test-layout-quiz-player.html)
- respond to roundStarted->roundFinished->...->gameFinished in the ui
- consider the time to "scale" the score
- check animations etc. in chrome, edge, firefox, safari
- should participants see the other players?
- try implement both a WebSocket adapter and an HttpRestAdapter, both should work to be "plugged in" without changing the code
- try if using <> works, or understand why it doesn't work
