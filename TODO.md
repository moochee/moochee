# TODO
- **Feature**: add real PPO quiz
- **UX**:unify background color podium + general
- **DoD**: deploy to CF (or even K8s?) and test performance (initial load vs cached) and device responsiveness
- **UX**: while joined player is waiting for quiz to start, should see the own avatar and the ones of the other players joining in
- **DoD**: check animations etc. in chrome, edge, firefox, safari and on mobile device
- **UX**: integrate stickies design in host + play screens (see test-layout-quiz-player.html)
- **Bugfix**: music not working on mobile device
- **Feature**: consider the time to "scale" the score
- **UX**: make host page nicer when waiting for players
- **Bugfix**: font sizes on post-its during quiz not scaling properly
- **Bugfix**: navigating to #/host/{gameId} or #/play/{gameId} should yield error if game doesn't exist
- **Bugfix**: close/delete game when finished, or auto-close a game 30min after it was started
- **Bugfix**: incorrect positioning & scaling of post-its and footer during quiz
- **Bugfix**: incorrect positioning of avatars on intermediate podium
- **Tech Improve**: try implement both a WebSocket adapter and an HttpRestAdapter, both should work to be "plugged in" without changing the code
- **Tech Improve**: try if using <> works, or understand why it doesn't work
- **Tech Improve**: try to remove "browser" env from eslint, we probably don't need any DOM APIs etc.
- **Tech Improve**: try find a clean way for importing the modules, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68648959/how-to-make-es6-modules-and-jsx-working-without-server-side-build
  - should then be able to remove the globals then in public/.eslintrc
  - should then be able to remove the rule exlusions in public/.eslintrc
