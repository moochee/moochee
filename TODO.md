# TODO
- **Tech Improve**: zero downtime deployment of stateful app
- **Feature**: implement an easy-to-use quiz creator
- **Feature** implement 'player is on fire', e.g. when climbed 3 times, or guessed right 3 times, or ...
- **Tech Improve**: calculate old/new score/ranking in backend
- **Bugfix**: music not working on Safari (incl iPhone) - need to use history.pushState (done already for host, not yet for players) _AND_ make sure the .play is triggered synchronously on a user interaction; right now there's multiple things making it async: a) we have an animation when clicking the sticky and b) we first call the backend to get the gameId before we enter the room. Possible solution: start the music immediately on click, but keep it muted, and unmute only once the "room" is entered successfully. Can there be other solutions? Related articles:

- **Bugfix**: close/delete game when finished, or auto-close a game 30min after it was started
- **Tech Improve**: try implement both a WebSocket client and an HttpRestClient, both should work to be "plugged in" without changing the code
- **Feature**: define secondsToGuess per quiz and per question in quiz json
- **Bugfix**: in scoreboard no. 1 overlaps with no. 2 in some cases
- **Feature**: show 3s count down before starting the first question


# DONE
- secure the app with sso
- play sound on host when player guesses to create more intensive competition atmosphere
- show newly joined players at the beginning, especially when having a large number of players
- split Game from Games
- show answer distribution and the correct answer as intermediate result
- replace socket.io with plain websocket
- center the stickies on the y-axis, consider both quiz stickies on entrance and answer stickies on play/host
- deploy to CF (or even K8s?) and test performance (initial load vs cached) and device responsiveness
- show progress on host/player side, current question and total number of questions
- navigating to #/host/{gameId} or #/play/{gameId} should yield error if game doesn't exist
- font sizes on post-its during quiz not scaling properly
- check animations etc. in chrome, edge, firefox, safari and on mobile device
- show number of players
- too many things are moving around in final podium, at least stage shall be still 
- be able to use jsx+es6 imports in combination, and clean the related messes in the global namespace
- integrate stickies design in host + play screens (see test-layout-quiz-player.html)
- while joined player is waiting for quiz to start, should see the own avatar and the ones of the other players joining in
- unify background color podium + general
- try to remove "browser" env from eslint, we probably don't need any DOM APIs etc.
- incorrect positioning & scaling of post-its and footer during quiz
- incorrect positioning of avatars on intermediate podium
- make host page nicer when waiting for players
- consider the time to "scale" the score
- score is 0 on player's screen
- add real PPO quiz
- migrate unit tests to use games.js
- simple eslint + formatter: use 4 spaces for indent, max 120 chars per line, no semicolon, always single quote (incl html)
- respond to roundStarted->roundFinished->...->gameFinished in the ui
- remove auto-transition for now, keep only next button
- timer/countdown
- display non-animated podium when transitioning to next question
- podium screen: display score
- handle players getting out in middle of the game
- QR code
- list multiple quizzes, select one to host a name
- podium screen, incl. participants with same score share the rank
- integrate with server using web sockets
- try own widget, e.g. post-its or fruits
- evaluate
- present next question
- animated transition
- avatars
- don't only deliver the question - also deliver the 4 possible answers!
- entrance screen (enter name and game id)
- create/host game
- join game
- copy url
- start the quiz after sufficient people joined
- guess the answer
